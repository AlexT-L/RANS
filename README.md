# RANS
RANS Modeling of Airfoil

## How to Run
The main file is the flo103.py. This can be run directly without any additional inputs. 

## How to Make Changes to Model
### Input
The current format of the input file is not reproducible. The easiest way will be to change the constructor from the input class to read a new geometry and new parameters. Input.py contains the information needed for an input object and would be needed in a new implementation.
