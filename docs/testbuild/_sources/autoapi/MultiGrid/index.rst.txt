.. py:class:: MultiGrid(workspace, model, integrator, input)

   Uses mulitple coarser grids to apply corrections to the values on the current grid.
       Correcting the soluion this way allows for much faster convergence to be achieved
       than if the solution were only updated with the finer grid

   Constructor:
       Args:
           workspace (Workspace):
               The workspace corresponding to the grid on which the solution will be calculated
           model (Model):
               The physics model to be used
           integrator (Integrator):
               The integration scheme to be used
           input (Dict):
               Dictionary of parameters containing:
                   ftim: the interval at which the stability will be updated
                   fcoll: the relaxation factor on the residuals transferred from the finer mesh

       Returns:
           A new Input object containing five dicts - dims, solv_param, flo_param, geo_param and in_var

       Notes:
           Check top of Input.py file to see the contents of each of the five dictionanries

   .. py:method:: performCycle(self)

      Performs one multi-grid cycle and calculates new state.




   .. py:method:: residuals(self, output)

      Copies the residual values to the output Field.

      :param output: Field that will store the residual values
      :type output: Field


   .. py:method:: solution(self, output)

      Copies the state values to the output Field.

      :param output: Field that will store the values
      :type output: Field
